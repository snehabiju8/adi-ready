# Adi Ready üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Unagi

### Project Description
Adi Ready is a Kerala Mosquito Detection & Response Simulator that lets you detect, hear, and attempt to smash pesky virtual mosquitoes. It plays random buzzing sounds, throws in sarcastic mosquito dialogues, and tests your reflexes.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People aren‚Äôt getting enough virtual mosquito-swatting practice, leading to slower reaction times when facing real buzzing threats at night.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a browser-based mosquito simulator that detects a mosquito, plays its annoying buzz, taunts you with mosquito trash talk, and lets you smash it‚Äîor fail miserably as it escapes laughing.
